  <h2>What is personality ?</h2>
  <p>The personality is the typical pattern of thinking, feeling, and behaviors that make a person unique.
 When we say that someone has a "good personality" we mean that they are likable, interesting and pleasant to be with.
 Everyone wants to be attractive to others. To that end, having a good personality is vital - probably even more so than good looks.</p>
    
    <p>In fact, approximately 85 percent of your success and happiness will be a result of how well you interact with others. Ultimately, it is your personality that determines whether people are attracted to, or shy away from you.
    While we can only enhance our looks to a certain extent, we can improve our personality as much as we want. We can develop or integrate into our personalities any trait we deem fitting and agreeable.</p>
